    "Plan here is to take our sampling distributions of text frequency, inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores for human and synthetic text and use them to generate a function that takes a TF-IDF score and converts it into a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) score. See the figure below from the [Wikipedia article on KLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence).\n",

    "Workflow is as follows:\n",
    "1. Get kernel density estimate of PR score distributions for human and synthetic text fragments in the training data.\n",
    "2. Calculated the KLD between the human and synthetic PR score distributions.\n",
    "3. Get a get kernel density estimate of the KLD.\n",
    "4. Use the probability density function from the KLD kernel density estimate to calculate a KLD score for each text fragment in the training and testing data.\n",
    "5. Add the KLD score as a new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above will be done individually for each fragment length bin and the combined data. This way the KLD score feature in each bin will capture the TF-IDF score distribution for text fragments in that specific length regime, rather that for the whole dataset."
