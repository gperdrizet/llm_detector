# Perplexity ratio score & model benchmarking notebooks

The notebooks in this directory contain data wrangling and EDA of human and synthetic text data from several sources and model performance benchmarking.

## 1. Data sources

### 1.1. Hans (2024)

This is the original data source used for the v1.0.0 text classifier. Data is available in the [Binoculars](https://github.com/ahans30/Binoculars/tree/main) GitHub repository provided in the [original publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12070#). Repo has BSD 3-Clause license.

The data came from completions of the first 50 tokens of texts from the CC News, CNN and PubMed datasets by LLaMA-2-13B and Falcon-7B. See the paper for more details

### 1.2. AI vs human text

This dataset is [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanegerami/ai-vs-human-text). It was uploaded some time late in 2023 by Shayan Gerami. The description is very short saying only that the dataset contains around 500k essays written by humans and machines from multiple sources. There is no mention of the sources, models used, prompts etc. License listed as other and not specified.

### 1.3. Human vs. LLM text corpus

Another [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starblasters8/human-vs-llm-text-corpus). This one by Zachary Grinberg, also from 2023. It contains about 800k text examples annotated with the source model (or human) and the prompt. The Kaggle dataset page also contains a list of sources, mostly other Kaggle datasets and HuggingFace.

### 1.4. Human-ChatGPT texts

Published by [Gaggar et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15425). The data appears to be available in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/HarshOza36/Detection-Of-Machine-Generated-Text/tree/master) associated with the paper. The data was generated by prompting GPT-3.5-turbo to rephrase human generated text from several sources. MIT license.

### 1.5. ai-text-detection-pile

[HuggingFace dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/artem9k/ai-text-detection-pile) with 1.4 million long form text records uploaded by Artem Yatsenko. Human text is from several documented sources and machine text is from several GPTs. The data itself is not annotated with source information. MIT license.
